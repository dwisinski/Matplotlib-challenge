## Project: Matplotlib Homework - Pymaceuticals

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data analysis concepts using a set of drug trial data. Data analysis was conducted using the matplotlib and pandas libraries for Python and the JupyterLab environment. Concepts covered include: importing/reading .csv files using pandas, creating and merging custom DataFrames, creating and formatting various plots and graphs using both pandas and matplotlib libraries, basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, etc.), calculation of quartiles, interquartile ranges and outliers, calculation of linear regression and correlation, etc.


## **Note:**
Observations and Insights about the data are included at the top of the notebook.
